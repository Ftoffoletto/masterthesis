The aim of this thesis is to determine whether electoral data conform to Benford's distribution. Additionally, it seeks to assess whether the law can be utilised to identify anomalies in such data. Following a brief introduction, including some historical context, a mathematical and formal definition is provided. This section also highlights several useful and intriguing applications. In the second chapter, the application of this rule to electoral data is explored, with references to relevant literature. The third chapter presents a practical analysis, employing data from Italian and US elections and specific statistical tests and metrics to evaluate the consistency of the data with Benford's law.
